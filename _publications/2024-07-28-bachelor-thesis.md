This thesis showcases the development of a client-server architecture for multiplayer using the Godot Game Engine. The implementation is for an in-development top-down RPG game by Giantsbane AB, a local indie game development company. The core implementation is designed as an arena for developers to engage in player versus player (PVP) combat for testing and a potential commercial use for the final game release. The implementation supports multiple concurrent instances, data synchronisation, and poor networking conditions for a seamless multiplayer experience. 

Significant achievements of this project include the practical implementation of a robust client-server model designed to support multiple concurrent game instances. Customizable game settings and configurations were developed, increasing the system's flexibility and adaptability for different gameplay styles and scenarios. The project established a solid foundation for future development, focusing on scalability. This paper details these implementations and discusses the challenges encountered, offering solutions and suggestions. It serves as an essential resource for developers seeking to utilize the Godot Engine for sophisticated multiplayer game functionalities.
